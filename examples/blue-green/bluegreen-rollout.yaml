        # This preStop sleep prevents the pod from exiting immediately upon a pod termination
        # event (e.g. during a rolling update). This gives some time for ingress controllers to
        # react to the Pod IP being removed from the Service's Endpoint list, preventing traffic
        # from being directed to the terminating pods, which otherwise would cause timeout errors
        # and/or request delays.
